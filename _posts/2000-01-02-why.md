## Stuff About me
So basically I program. That's most of what I do when I am not doing other things like sleeping, eating, working, or going to school. Not much else to say.
I like to play video games. I like making random things that never really see the light of day and some even make it onto my github.

I'll probably edit this and put more here as I think of it.
